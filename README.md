## Semi-Supervised Active Learning to Efficiently Train a Classifier on a High Volume of Unlabelled Images

An assignment for the course Big Data in the master Information Studies at the University of Amsterdam

The paper written to describe the process can be found [here](BigDataPaper_JetteKorthalsAltes10360328.pdf)

Seven networks are trained:
* [Semi-supervised active learning with clustering](SSALcluster.ipynb)
* [Semi-supervised active learning with random initialisation](SSALrandom.ipynb)
* [Active learning with clustering](ALcluster.ipynb)
* [Active learning with random initialisation](ALrandom.ipynb)
* [Semi-supervised learning](semi.ipynb)
* [Supervised learning with retraining](supervisedretrain.ipynb)
* [Supervised learning without retraining](supervised.ipynb)
